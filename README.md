<p>This Empathy/Adium theme is my personal adaptation of the Ravenant Dust one, available <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Empathy/Themes/Ravenant_Dust">here</a>. Thus, the majority of the code is not mine, I just adapted it to my taste, with some CSS tweaking.</p>

<p>I find it less messy, and classier. But that's just me!</p>

<h2>How do I install it?</h2>

Go to your personal <code>local/share</code> directory :
<pre>$ cd ~/.local/share/</pre></p>

<p>If there is no <code>adium/</code> directory, create one :
<pre>$ mkdir -p adium/message-styles</pre></p>

<p>In the <code>~/.local/share/adium/message-styles/</code> directory, copy/paste the <code>Ravenant_Light.AdiumMessageStyle</code> directory.</p>

<p>In empathy, go to Edit > Preferences > Themes and then choose Ravenant Light.</p>

<p>These instructions are valid for a Linux distrib (I run Ubuntu). Empathy themes being based on Adium, I guess all that could workd on MacOSX too.</p>
